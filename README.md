# GTSRB
In this project Convolutional Neural Networks were implemented on the GTSRB data to build a traffic sign recognition model. The data is available at https://sid.erda.dk/public/archives/daaeac0d7ce1152aea9b61d9f1e19370/published-archive.html

From the this website the GTRSB-Final_Training_Images.zip, the GTRSB-Final_Test_Images.zip and the GTSRB-Final_Test_GT.zip were used.

This repository contains: 

● The Jupyter Notebook for building and analysing the models 

● The Python Code for building and analysing the models 

● A ZIP-Folder containing the models (as .json) and the weights (as .h5) 

● A .html file to display the notebook in a browser 




The implementation was done in Python 3.7.3
